## Run tests

To be able to run tests you need to have installed 
node on your machine.

You also need to run the command `npm install` to download
all the dependencies for the project.

To run all the tests you can use command:

```
npm run test
``` 

To run them in watch mode (with restarting tests 
after changing files) you can add --watch flag:

```
npm run test -- --watch
```
